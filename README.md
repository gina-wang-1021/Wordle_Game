# Purpose & How to Use
Wordle was a small game I use to relax myself and take a tiny break between work. However, the New York Times version only allowed us to play the game once a day, so I created my own version of Wordle.\

This is a recreation of the Wordle Game that implements basic functions of the game, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.\
